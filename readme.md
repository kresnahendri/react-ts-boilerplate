# React Typescript Boilerplate

Minimal Express REST API boilerplate using RxJS

## Motivation

**React** is great UI library for web development. In previous, I use **ES6** for its languange, but it is hard to maintain, because there is much data and state that is alive in application. I have to guess what is type of props in one component? how many props does the component have? Front end will be larger and more complicated as time goes by. And.. **Typescript** save your live! Happy coding!

## Tools

- Language: `typescript`
- Routing: `react-router-dom`
- Fetch API: `axios`
- Async handler: `rxjs@6`
- State management: `unstead`
- Styling: `styled-component`
- Grid layout: `bootstrap-4-grid`
- Animation: `css` and `rxjs` (WIP)
- Bundler: `webpack@4`
